Q) Scenario: 
You are designing a permissioned blockchain for a supply chain network. The blockchain 
should: 
â€¢ Support multiple companies who do not fully trust each other 
â€¢ Allow selective sharing of transactions between participants 
â€¢ Be efficient in terms of consensus and scalability 
Task: 
â€¢ What blockchain framework would you choose (Hyperledger Fabric, Substrate, or 
Ethereum L2)? 
â€¢ Justify your choice and explain: 
o How consensus will be handled 
o How privacy and selective transaction visibility will be ensured 
o What role smart contracts play in your design


ans)  For a permissioned blockchain for a supply chain network, the best framework choice would be Hyperledger Fabric. Here's why:

ðŸ”¹ Why Hyperledger Fabric?
Permissioned Nature: Fabric is designed for enterprise use cases where multiple organizations participate in a blockchain network but do not fully trust each other.
Selective Transaction Sharing: It supports private channels and data confidentiality, allowing specific participants to see only relevant transactions.
Efficient Consensus: Fabric does not rely on energy-intensive Proof-of-Work but instead uses a pluggable consensus model suited for scalability.
Smart Contract (Chaincode) Support: It enables custom business logic execution while ensuring regulatory compliance.
 How Key Aspects are Handled:
1) Consensus Mechanism
Fabric uses a modular approach to consensus, allowing organizations to choose the best model for their needs.
Recommended consensus mechanisms:
Raft (Leader-based crash fault-tolerant consensus): Suitable for scalability.
BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) Algorithms (e.g., IBFT, SBFT) for additional security.
Why?
Efficient and scalable compared to PoW/PoS.
Works well in permissioned settings where participants are known entities.
2)Privacy & Selective Transaction Visibility
Fabric uses Private Data Collections & Channels:
Private Channels: Only participants in the channel can see transactions.
Private Data Collections: Specific subsets of data are accessible only to authorized participants.
Access Control via MSPs (Membership Service Providers)
Each organization has its own identity issued by a CA (Certificate Authority).
Transactions are only shared with the relevant parties.
3) Role of Smart Contracts (Chaincode)
Automate Business Logic: Fabric uses Chaincode (Smart Contracts) written in Go, Java, or JavaScript to define transaction rules.
Supply Chain Use Cases:
Product Tracking: Chaincode ensures that each product movement (manufacturing â†’ distribution â†’ retail) is logged immutably.
Compliance & Audits: Regulators can have read-only access to verify compliance without seeing proprietary business data.
Automated Settlements: Payments and contractual obligations can be enforced using chaincode logic.
